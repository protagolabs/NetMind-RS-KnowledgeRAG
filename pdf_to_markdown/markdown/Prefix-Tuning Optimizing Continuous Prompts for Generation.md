# Abstract  

Fine-tuning is the de facto way to leverage large pretrained language models to perform downstream tasks. However, it modifies all the language model parameters and therefore necessitates storing a full copy for each task. In this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters frozen, but optimizes a small continuous task-specific vector (called the prefix). Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting, allowing subsequent tokens to attend to this prefix as if it were “virtual tokens”. We apply prefix-tuning to GPT-2 for table-to-text generation and to BART for summarization. We find that by learning only $0.1\%$ of the parameters, prefix-tuning obtains comparable performance in the full data setting, outperforms fine-tuning in low-data settings, and extrapolates better to examples with topics unseen during training.  

Fine-tuning is the prevalent paradigm for using large pretrained language models (LMs) (Radford et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019) to perform downstream tasks (e.g., summarization), but it requires updating and storing all the parameters of the LM. Consequently, to build and deploy NLP systems that rely on large pretrained LMs, one currently needs to store a modified copy of the LM parameters for each task. This can be prohibitively expensive, given the large size of current LMs; for example, GPT-2 has 774M parameters (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT-3 has 175B parameters (Brown et al., 2020).

Figure 1: Fine-tuning (top) updates all Transformer parameters (the red Transformer box) and requires storing a full model copy for each task. We propose prefix-tuning (bottom), which freezes the Transformer parameters and only optimizes the prefix (the red prefix blocks). Consequently, we only need to store the prefix for each task, making prefix-tuning modular and space-efficient. Note that each vertical block denote transformer activations at one time step.  

# 1 Introduction  

A natural approach to this problem is lightweight fine-tuning, which freezes most of the pretrained parameters and augments the model with small trainable modules. For example, adapter-tuning (Rebuffi et al., 2017; Houlsby et al., 2019) inserts additional task-specific layers between the layers of pretrained language models. Adapter-tuning has promising performance on natural language understanding and generation benchmarks, attaining comparable performance with fine-tuning while adding only around $2\%$ task-specific parameters (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020).  

On the extreme end, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) can be deployed without any task-specific tuning. Instead, users prepend a natural language task instruction (e.g., $T L;D R$ for summarization) and a few examples to the task input; then generate the output from the LM. This approach is known as in-context learning or prompting.  

In this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, inspired by prompting. Consider the task of generating a textual description of a data table, as shown in Figure 1, where the task input is a linearized table (e.g., “name: Starbucks type: coffee shop”) and the output is a textual description (e.g., “Starbucks serves coffee.”). Prefix-tuning prepends a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors to the input, which we call a prefix, depicted by red blocks in Figure 1 (bottom). For subsequent tokens, the Transformer can attend to the prefix as if it were a sequence of “virtual tokens”, but unlike prompting, the prefix consists entirely of free parameters which do not correspond to real tokens. In contrast to fine-tuning in Figure 1 (top), which updates all Transformer parameters and thus requires storing a tuned copy of the model for each task, prefix-tuning only optimizes the prefix. Consequently, we only need to store one copy of the large Transformer and a learned task-specific prefix, yielding a very small overhead for each additional task (e.g., 250K parameters for table-to-text).  

In contrast to fine-tuning, prefix-tuning is modular: we train an upstream prefix which steers a downstream LM, which remains unmodified. Thus, a single LM can support many tasks at once. In the context of personalization where the tasks correspond to different users (Shokri and Shmatikov, 2015; McMahan et al., 2016), we could have a separate prefix for each user trained only on that user’s data, thereby avoiding data cross-contamination. Moreover, the prefix-based architecture enables us to even process examples from multiple users/tasks in a single batch, something that is not possible with other lightweight fine-tuning approaches.  

We evaluate prefix-tuning on table-to-text generation using GPT-2 and abstractive summarization using BART. In terms of storage, prefix-tuning stores $1000\mathrm{x}$ fewer parameters than fine-tuning. In terms of performance when trained on full datasets, prefix-tuning and fine-tuning are comparable for table-to-text $(\S6.1)$ , while prefix-tuning suffers a small degradation for summarization $(\S6.2)$ . In lowdata settings, prefix-tuning on average outperforms fine-tuning on both tasks $(\S6.3)$ . Prefix-tuning also extrapolates better to tables (for table-to-text) and articles (for summarization) with unseen topics (§6.4).  

# 2 Related Work  

Fine-tuning for natural language generation. Current state-of-the-art systems for natural language generation are based on fine-tuning pretrained LMs. For table-to-text generation, Kale (2020) fine-tunes a sequence-to-sequence model (T5; Raffel et al., 2020). For extractive and abstractive summarization, researchers fine-tune masked language models (e.g., BERT; Devlin et al., 2019) and encode-decoder models (e.g., BART; Lewis et al., 2020) respectively (Zhong et al., 2020; Liu and Lapata, 2019; Raffel et al., 2020). For other conditional NLG tasks such as machine translation and dialogue generation, fine-tuning is also the prevalent paradigm (Zhang et al., 2020c; Stickland et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). In this paper, we focus on table-to-text using GPT-2 and summarization using BART, but prefix-tuning can be applied to other generation tasks and pretrained models.  

Lightweight fine-tuning. Lightweight finetuning freezes most of the pretrained parameters and modifies the pretrained model with small trainable modules. The key challenge is to identify high-performing architectures of the modules and the subset of pretrained parameters to tune. One line of research considers removing parameters: some model weights are ablated away by training a binary mask over model parameters (Zhao et al., 2020; Radiya-Dixit and Wang, 2020). Another line of research considers inserting parameters. For example, Zhang et al. (2020a) trains a “side” network that is fused with the pretrained model via summation; adapter-tuning inserts task-specific layers (adapters) between each layer of the pretrained LM (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2020). Compared to this line of work, which tunes around $3.6\%$ of the LM parameters, our method obtains a further $30\mathrm{x}$ reduction in task-specific parameters, tuning only $0.1\%$ while maintaining comparable performance.  

Prompting. Prompting means prepending instructions and a few examples to the task input and generating the output from the LM. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) uses manually designed prompts to adapt its generation for different tasks, and this framework is termed in-context learning. However, since Transformers can only condition on a bounded-length context (e.g., 2048 tokens for GPT3), in-context learning is unable to fully exploit training sets longer than the context window. Sun and Lai (2020) also prompt by keywords to control for sentiment or topic of the generated sentence. In natural language understanding tasks, prompt engineering has been explored in prior works for models like BERT and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Schick and Sch¨utze, 2020). For example, AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) searches for a sequence of discrete trigger words and concatenates it with each input to elicit sentiment or factual knowledge from a masked LM. In contrast with AutoPrompt, our method optimizes continuous prefixes, which are more expressive $(\S7.2)$ ; moreover, we focus on language generation tasks.  

Continuous vectors have been used to steer language models; for example, Subramani et al. (2020) showed that a pretrained LSTM language model can reconstruct arbitrary sentences by optimizing a continuous vector for each sentence, making the vector input-specific. In contrast, prefix-tuning optimizes a task-specific prefix that applies to all instances of that task. As a result, unlike the previous work whose application is limited to sentence reconstruction, prefix-tuning can be applied to NLG tasks.  

Controllable generation. Controllable generation aims to steer a pretrained language model to match a sentence level attribute (e.g., positive sentiment or topic on sports). Such control can happen at training time: Keskar et al. (2019) pretrains the language model (CTRL) to condition on metadata such as keywords or URLs. Additionally, the control can happen at decoding time, by weighted decoding (GeDi, Krause et al., 2020) or iteratively updating the past activations (PPLM, Dathathri et al., 2020). However, there is no straightforward way to apply these controllable generation techniques to enforce fine-grained control over generated contents, as demanded by tasks like table-to-text and summarization.  

# 3 Problem Statement  

Consider a conditional generation task where the input is a context $x$ and the output $y$ is a sequence of tokens. We focus on two tasks, shown in Figure 2 (right): In table-to-text, $x$ corresponds to a linearized data table and $y$ is a textual description; in summarization, $x$ is an article and $y$ is a short summary.  

# 3.1 Autoregressive LM  

Assume we have an autoregressive language model $p_{\phi}(y\mid x)$ based on the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture (e.g., GPT-2; Radford et al.,  

2019) and parametrized by $\phi$ . As shown in Figure 2 (top), let $z=[x;y]$ be the concatenation of $x$ and $y$ ; let ${\sf X}_{\sf i d x}$ denote the sequence of indices that corresponds to $x$ , and $\mathsf{Y}_{\mathsf{i d x}}$ denote the same for $y$ .  

The activation at time step $i$ is $h_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ , where $h_{i}=[h_{i}^{(1)};\cdots;h_{i}^{(n)}]$ is a concatenation of all activation layers at this time step, and hi(j) is the activation of the $j$ -th Transformer layer at time step $i$ .1  

The autoregressive Transformer model computes $h_{i}$ as a function of $z_{i}$ and the past activations in its left context, as follows:  

$$
h_{i}=\mathrm{LM}_{\phi}(z_{i},h_{<i}),
$$  

where the last layer of $h_{i}$ is used to compute the distribution for the next token: $p_{\phi}(z_{i+1}\mid h_{\leq i})=$ softmax $(W_{\phi}\:h_{i}^{(n)})$ and $W_{\phi}$ is a pretrained matrix that map $h_{i}^{(n)}$ to logits over the vocabulary.  

# 3.2 Encoder-Decoder Architecture  

We can also use an encoder-decoder architecture (e.g., BART; Lewis et al., 2020) to model $p_{\phi}(y\mid x)$ , where $x$ is encoded by the bidirectional encoder, and the decoder predicts $y$ autoregressively (conditioned on the encoded $x$ and its left context). We use the same indexing and activation notation, as shown in Figure 2 (bottom). $h_{i}$ for all $i\in\mathsf{X}_{\mathsf{i d x}}$ is computed by the bidirectional Transformer encoder; $h_{i}$ for all $i\in\mathsf{Y}_{\mathsf{i d x}}$ is computed by the autoregressive decoder using the same equation (1).  

# 3.3 Method: Fine-tuning  

In the fine-tuning framework, we initialize with the pretrained parameters $\phi$ . Here $p_{\phi}$ is a trainable language model distribution and we perform gradient updates on the following log-likelihood objective:  

$$
\operatorname*{max}_{\phi}\log p_{\phi}(y\mid x)=\sum_{i\in\Upsilon_{{\mathrm{idx}}}}\log p_{\phi}(z_{i}\mid h_{<i}).
$$  

# 4 Prefix-Tuning  

We propose prefix-tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for conditional generation tasks. We first provide intuition in $\S4.1$ before defining our method formally in $\S4.2$ .  

![](https://netmind-public-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccaffd409da54650bd69313110d28b9c/a89e7aad4b172235a3f5d32354cce94a4235f069682595ba1fc9cd90d82cc2a7.jpg)  
Figure 2: An annotated example of prefix-tuning using an autoregressive LM (top) and an encoder-decoder model (bottom). The prefix activations $\forall i\in\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{i d x}},h_{i}$ are drawn from a trainable matrix $P_{\theta}$ . The remaining activations are computed by the Transformer.  

# 4.1 Intuition  

Based on intuition from prompting, we believe that having a proper context can steer the LM without changing its parameters. For example, if we want the LM to generate a word (e.g., Obama), we can prepend its common collocations as context (e.g., Barack), and the LM will assign much higher probability to the desired word. Extending this intuition beyond generating a single word or sentence, we want to find a context that steers the LM to solve an NLG task. Intuitively, the context can influence the encoding of $x$ by guiding what to extract from $x$ ; and can influence the generation of $y$ by steering the next token distribution. However, it’s non-obvious whether such a context exists. Natural language task instructions (e.g., “summarize the following table in one sentence”) might guide an expert annotator to solve the task, but fail for most pretrained LMs.2 Data-driven optimization over the discrete instructions might help, but discrete optimization is computationally challenging.  

Instead of optimizing over discrete tokens, we can optimize the instruction as continuous word embeddings, whose effects will be propagated upward to all Transformer activation layers and rightward to subsequent tokens. This is strictly more expressive than a discrete prompt which requires matching the embedding of a real word. Meanwhile, this is less expressive than intervening all layers of the activations $(\S7.2)$ , which avoids long-range dependencies and includes more tunable parameters. Prefix-tuning, therefore, optimizes all layers of the prefix.  

# 4.2 Method  

Prefix-tuning prepends a prefix for an autoregressive LM to obtain $z=[\mathrm{PREFIX};x;y]$ , or prepends prefixes for both encoder and encoder to obtain $z=[\mathrm{PREFIX};x;\mathrm{PREFIX}^{\prime};y],$ , as shown in Figure 2. Here, $\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{id}\mathsf{x}}$ denotes the sequence of prefix indices, and we use $|\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{i d}\times}|$ to denote the length of the prefix.  

We follow the recurrence relation in equation (1), except that the prefix are free parameters. Prefix-tuning initializes a trainable matrix $P_{\theta}$ (parametrized by $\theta$ ) of dimension $|\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{i d x}}|\times\dim(h_{i})$ to store the prefix parameters.  

$$
h_{i}=\left\{{\begin{array}{l l}{P_{\theta}[i,:],}&{{\mathrm{if~}}i\in\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{idx}},}\\ {{\mathrm{LM}}_{\phi}(z_{i},h_{<i}),}&{{\mathrm{otherwise}}.}\end{array}}\right.
$$  

The training objective is the same as equation (2), but the set of trainable parameters changes: the language model parameters $\phi$ are fixed and the prefix parameters $\theta$ are the only trainable parameters.  

Here, $h_{i}$ (for all $i$ ) is a function of the trainable $P_{\theta}$ . When $i\in\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{i d x}}$ , this is clear because $h_{i}$ copies directly from $P_{\theta}$ . When $i\not\in{\sf P}_{\mathrm{id}\times}$ , $h_{i}$ still depends on $P_{\theta}$ , because the prefix activations are always in the left context and will therefore affect any activations to its right.  

# 4.3 Parametrization of $P_{\theta}$  

Empirically, directly updating the $P_{\theta}$ parameters leads to unstable optimization and a slight drop in performance.3 So we reparametrize the matrix $\begin{array}{r}{P_{\theta}[i,:]=\mathbf{M}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{P}_{\theta}(P_{\theta}^{\prime}[i,:])}\end{array}$ by a smaller matrix $(P_{\theta}^{\prime})$ composed with a large feedforward neural network $\mathrm{(MLP}_{\theta}$ ). Note that $P_{\theta}$ and $P_{\theta}^{\prime}$ has the same rows dimension (i.e. the prefix length), but different columns dimension.4 Once training is complete, these reparametrization parameters can be dropped, and only the prefix $(P_{\theta})$ needs to be saved.  

# 5 Experimental Setup  

# 5.1 Datasets and Metrics  

We evaluate on three standard neural generation datasets for the table-to-text task: E2E (Novikova et al., 2017), WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017), and DART (Radev et al., 2020). The datasets are ordered by increasing complexity and size. E2E only has 1 domain (i.e. restaurant reviews); WebNLG has 14 domains, and DART is open-domain, using open-domain tables from Wikipedia.  

The E2E dataset contains approximately 50K examples with 8 distinct fields; it contains multiple test references for one source table, and the average output length is 22.9. We use the official evaluation script, which reports BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Belz and Reiter, 2006), METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), and CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015).  

The WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) dataset consists of 22K examples, and the input $x$ is a sequence of (subject, property, object) triples. The average output length is 22.5. In the training and validation splits, the input describes entities from 9 distinct DBpedia categories (e.g., Monument). The test split consists of two parts: the first half contains DB categories seen in training data, and the second half contains 5 unseen categories. These unseen categories are used to evaluate extrapolation. We use the official evaluation script, which reports BLEU, METEOR and TER (Snover et al., 2006).  

DART (Radev et al., 2020) is an open domain table-to-text dataset, with similar input format (entity-relation-entity triples) as WebNLG. The average output length is 21.6. It consists of 82K examples from WikiSQL, WikiTableQuestions, E2E, and WebNLG and applies some manual or automated conversion. We use the official evaluation script and report BLEU, METEOR, TER, MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019), BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020b) and BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020).  

For the summarization task, we use the XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018) dataset, which is an abstractive summarization dataset on news articles. There are 225K examples. The average length of the articles is 431 words and the average length of the summaries is 23.3. We report ROUGE-1, ROUGE2 and ROUGE-L.  

# 5.2 Methods  

For table-to-text generation, we compare prefixtuning with three other methods: fine-tuning (FINETUNE), fine-tuning only the top 2 layers (FT-TOP2), and adapter-tuning (ADAPTER).5 We also report the current state-of-the-art results on these datasets: On E2E, Shen et al. (2019) uses a pragmatically informed model without pretraining. On WebNLG, Kale (2020) fine-tunes T5-large. On DART, no official models trained on this dataset version are released.6 For summarization, we compare against fine-tuning BART (Lewis et al., 2020).  

# 5.3 Architectures and Hyperparameters  

For table-to-text, we use GPT-2MEDIUM and GPT$2_{\mathrm{LARGE}}$ ; the source tables are linearized.7 For summarization, we use BARTLARGE,8 and the source articles are truncated to 512 BPE tokens.  

Our implementation is based on the Hugging Face Transformer models (Wolf et al., 2020). At training time, we use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) and a linear learning rate scheduler, as suggested by the Hugging Face default setup. The hyperparameters we tune include the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and prefix length. Hyperparameter details are in the appendix. A default setting trains for 10 epochs, using a batch size of 5, a learning rate of $5\cdot10^{-5}$ and a prefix length of 10. The table-to-text models are trained on TITAN Xp or GeForce GTX TITAN X machines. Prefix-tuning takes 0.2 hours per epochs to train on 22K examples , whereas finetuning takes around 0.3 hours. The summarization models are trained on Tesla V100 machines, taking $1.25\mathrm{h}$ per epoch on the XSUM dataset.  

At decoding time, for the three table-to-text datasets, we use beam search with a beam size of 5. For summarization, we use a beam size of 6 and length normalization of 0.8. Decoding takes 1.2 seconds per sentence (without batching) for table-to-text, and 2.6 seconds per batch (using a batch size of 10) for summarization.  

# 6 Main Results  

# 6.1 Table-to-text Generation  

We find that adding only $0.1\%$ task-specific parameters,9 prefix-tuning is effective in table-to-text generation, outperforming other lightweight baselines (ADAPTER and FT-TOP2) and achieving a comparable performance with fine-tuning. This trend is true across all three datasets: E2E, WebNLG,10 and DART.  

For a fair comparison, we match the number of parameters for prefix-tuning and adapter-tuning to be $0.1\%$ . Table 1 shows that prefix-tuning is significantly better than ADAPTER $(0.1\%)$ , attaining 4.1 BLEU improvement per dataset on average. Even when we compare with fine-tuning $(100\%)$ and adapter-tuning $(3.0\%)$ , which update significantly more parameters than prefix-tuning, prefixtuning still achieves results comparable or better than those two systems. This demonstrates that prefix-tuning is more Pareto efficient than adaptertuning, significantly reducing parameters while improving generation quality.  

Additionally, attaining good performance on DART suggests that prefix-tuning can generalize to tables with diverse domains and a large pool of relations. We will delve deeper into extrapolation performance (i.e. generalization to unseen categories or topics) in $\S6.4$ .  

Overall, prefix-tuning is an effective and spaceefficient method to adapt GPT-2 to table-to-text generation. The learned prefix is expressive enough to steer GPT-2 in order to correctly extract contents from an unnatural format and generate a textual description. Prefix-tuning also scales well from GPT-2MEDIUM to GPT-2LARGE, suggesting it has the potential to scale to even larger models with a similar architecture, like GPT-3.  

# 6.2 Summarization  

As shown in Table 2, with $2\%$ parameters, prefixtuning obtains slightly lower performance than finetuning (36.05 vs. 37.25 in ROUGE-L). With only $0.1\%$ parameters, prefix-tuning underperforms full fine-tuning (35.05 vs. 37.25). There are several differences between XSUM and the three table-totext datasets which could account for why prefixtuning has comparative advantage in table-to-text: (1) XSUM contains $4\mathrm{x}$ more examples than the three table-to-text datasets on average; (2) the input articles are $17\mathrm{x}$ longer than the linearized table input of table-to-text datasets on average; (3) summarization might be more complex than table-totext because it requires reading comprehension and identifying key contents from an article.  

# 6.3 Low-data Setting  

Based on the results from table-to-text (§6.1) and summarization $(\S6.2)$ , we observe that prefixtuning has a comparative advantage when the number of training examples is smaller. To construct low-data settings, we subsample the full dataset (E2E for table-to-text and XSUM for summarization) to obtain small datasets of size $\{50,100,200,500\}$ . For each size, we sample 5 different datasets and average over 2 training random seeds. Thus, we average over 10 models to get an estimate for each low-data setting.11  

Figure 3 (right) shows that prefix-tuning outperforms fine-tuning in low-data regimes by 2.9 BLEU on average, in addition to requiring many fewer parameters, but the gap narrows as the dataset size increases.  

Qualitatively, Figure 3 (left) shows 8 examples generated by both prefix-tuning and fine-tuning models trained on different data levels. While both methods tend to undergenerate (missing table contents) in low data regimes, prefix-tuning tends to be more faithful than fine-tuning. For example, finetuning $(100,200)^{12}$ falsely claims a low customer rating while the true rating is average, whereas prefix-tuning (100, 200) generates a description that is faithful to the table.  

# 6.4 Extrapolation  

We now investigate extrapolation performance to unseen topics for both table-to-text and summarization. In order to construct an extrapolation setting, we split the existing datasets so that training and test cover different topics. For table-to-text, the  

Table 1: Metrics (higher is better, except for TER) for table-to-text generation on E2E (left), WebNLG (middle) and DART (right). With only $0.1\%$ parameters, Prefix-tuning outperforms other lightweight baselines and achieves a comparable performance with fine-tuning. The best score is boldfaced for both GPT-2MEDIUM and GPT- $\cdot2_{\mathrm{L}}$ ARGE.

WebNLG dataset is labeled with table topics. There are 9 categories that appear in training and dev, denoted as SEEN and 5 categories that only appear at test time, denoted as UNSEEN. So we evaluate extrapolation by training on the SEEN categories and testing on the UNSEEN categories. For summarization, we construct two extrapolation data splits13: In news-to-sports, we train on news articles, and test on sports articles. In within-news, we train on world, UK, business news, and test on the remaining news categories (e.g., health, technology).  

On both table-to-text and summarization, prefixtuning has better extrapolation than fine-tuning under all metrics, as shown in Table 3 and the ‘U’ columns of Table 1 (middle).  

We also find that adapter-tuning achieves good extrapolation performance, comparable with prefixtuning, as shown in Table 1. This shared trend suggests that preserving LM parameters indeed has a positive impact on extrapolation. However, the reason for such gains is an open question and we will discuss further in $\S8$ .

Figure 4: Prefix length vs. performance on summerization (left) and table-to-text (right). Performance increases as the prefix length increases up to a threshold (200 for summarization and 10 for table-to-text) and then a slight performance drop occurs. Each plot reports two metrics (on two vertical axes).  

# 7 Intrinsic Evaluation  

We compare different variants of prefix-tuning. $\S7.1$ studies the impact of the prefix length. $\S7.2$ studies tuning only the embedding layer, which is more akin to tuning a discrete prompt. $\S7.3$ compares prefixing and infixing, which inserts trainable activations between $x$ and $y$ . $\S7.4$ studies the impact of various prefix initialization strategies.  

# 7.1 Prefix Length  

A longer prefix means more trainable parameters, and therefore more expressive power. Figure 4 shows that performance increases as the prefix length increases up to a threshold (200 for summarization, 10 for table-to-text) and then a slight performance drop occurs.14  

Empirically, longer prefixes have a negligible impact on inference speed, because attention computation over the entire prefix is parallellized on GPUs.  

# 7.2 Full vs Embedding-only  

Recall in $\S4.1$ , we discuss the option of optimizing the continuous embeddings of the “virtual tokens.” We instantiate that idea and call it embedding-only ablation. The word embeddings are free parameters, and the upper activation layers are computed by the Transformer. Table 4 (top) shows that the performance drops significantly, suggesting that tuning only the embedding layer is not sufficiently expressive.  

The embedding-only ablation upper bounds the performance of discrete prompt optimization (Shin

Figure 5: Initializing the prefix with activations of real words significantly outperforms random initialization, in low-data settings.  

et al., 2020), because discrete prompt restricts the embedding layer to exactly match the embedding of a real word. Consequently, we have this chain of increasing expressive power: discrete prompting $<$ embedding-only ablation $<$ prefix-tuning.  

# 7.3 Prefixing vs Infixing  

We also investigate how the trainable activations’ position in the sequence affects performance. In prefix-tuning, we place them at the beginning $\left[\mathrm{PREFIX};x;y\right]$ . We can also place the trainable activations between $x$ and $y$ (i.e. $[x;\operatorname{INFIX};y])$ and call this infix-tuning. Table 4 (bottom) shows that infix-tuning slightly underperforms prefix-tuning. We believe this is because prefix-tuning can affect the activations of $x$ and $y$ whereas infix-tuning can only influence the activations of $y$ .  

# 7.4 Initialization  

We find that how the prefix is initialized has a large impact in low-data settings. Random initialization leads to low performance with high variance. Initializing the prefix with activations of real words significantly improves generation, as shown in Figure 5. In particular, initializing with task relevant words such as “summarization” and “table-to-text” obtains slightly better performance than task irrelevant words such as “elephant” and “divide”, but using real words is still better than random.  

Since we initialize the prefix with activations of real words computed by the LM, this initialization strategy is concordant with preserving the pretrained LM as much as possible.  

# 8 Discussion  

In this section, we will discuss several favorable properties of prefix-tuning and some open problems.  

# 8.1 Personalization  

As we note in $\S1$ , prefix-tuning is advantageous when there are a large number of tasks that needs to be trained independently. One practical setting is user privacy (Shokri and Shmatikov, 2015; McMahan et al., 2016). In order to preserve user privacy, each user’s data needs to be separated and a personalized model needs to be trained independently for each user. Consequently, each user can be regarded as an independent task. If there are millions of users, prefix-tuning can scale to this setting and maintain modularity, enabling flexible addition or deletion of users by adding or deleting their prefixes without cross-contamination.  

# 8.2 Batching Across Users  

Under the same personalization setting, prefixtuning allows batching different users’ queries even though they are backed by different prefixes. When multiple users query a cloud GPU device with their inputs, it is computationally efficient to put these users in the same batch. Prefix-tuning keeps the shared LM intact; consequently, batching requires a simple step of prepending the personalized prefix to user input, and all the remaining computation is unchanged. In contrast, we can’t batch across different users in adapter-tuning, which has personalized adapters between shared Transformer layers.  

# 8.3 Inductive Bias of Prefix-tuning  

Recall that fine-tuning updates all pretrained parameters, whereas prefix-tuning and adapter-tuning preserve them. Since the language models are pretrained on general purpose corpus, preserving the LM parameters might help generalization to domains unseen during training. In concordance with this intuition, we observe that both prefix-tuning and adapter-tuning have significant performance gain in extrapolation settings (§6.4); however, the reason for such gain is an open question.  

While prefix-tuning and adapter-tuning both freeze the pretrained parameters, they tune different sets of parameters to affect the activation layers of the Transformer. Recall that prefix-tuning keeps the LM intact and uses the prefix and the pretrained attention blocks to affect the subsequent activations; adapter-tuning inserts trainable modules between LM layers, which directly add residual vectors to the activations. Moreover, we observe that prefixtuning requires vastly fewer parameters compared to adapter-tuning while maintaining comparable performance. We think this gain in parameter efficiency is because prefix-tuning keeps the pretrained LM intact as much as possible, and therefore exploits the LM more than adapter-tuning.  

Concurrent work by Aghajanyan et al. (2020) uses intrinsic dimension to show that there exists a low dimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full parameter space. This explains why good accuracy on downstream task can be obtained by updating only a small number of parameters. Our work echoes the finding by showing that good generation performance can be attained by updating a very small prefix.  

# 9 Conclusion  

We have proposed prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning that prepends a trainable continuous prefix for NLG tasks. We discover that despite learning $1000\mathrm{x}$ fewer parameters than finetuning, prefix-tuning can maintain a comparable performance in a full data setting and outperforms fine-tuning in both low-data and extrapolation settings.

# A Supplementary Material  

# A.1 Hyperparameters  

In Table 5, we report the hyperparameters used to train the models documented in the experiment section.  

# A.2 Additional Results for Low-data Settings  

Figure 6 supplements the low-data performance curves in Figure 3 by plotting the relationship between training size and generation metrics for both prefix-tuning and fine-tuning.  

# A.3 Additional Results for the Initialization Experiment  

Figure 7 supplements Figure 3 by plotting additional metrics for our initialization technique $\S7.4$ . It validates that random initialization (from a uniform (0,1) distirbution) significantly underperforms initializing with real words; Additionally, initializing with task-relevant words (e.g., “summarization” and “table-to-text”) attains slightly better generation scores than initializing with task-irrelevant words (e.g., “elephant” and “banana”).  

# A.4 Qualitative Examples for Extrapolation  

Table 6 contains qualitative examples from both seen and unseen categories in WebNLG. We find that for unseen categories, both prefix-tuning and fine-tuning tend to undergenerate (generated output do not cover full table contents) or generate untruthfully (generated output is inconsistent with table contents). In particular, prefix-tuning tends to undergenerate whereas fine-tuning tends to generate untruthfully. For seen categories, both perform fairly well in terms of coverage and truthfulness.

Table 6: Qualitative examples from WebNLG. The first 6 examples are from the unseen categories, labeled next to source; the last two examples are from the seen categories. For unseen categories, both prefix-tuning and finetuning tend to undergenerate (generated output do not cover full table contents) or generate untruthfully (generated output is inconsistent with table contents). In particular, prefix-tuning tends to undergenerate more often than generate untruthfully whereas fine-tuning tends to generate untruthfully. For seen categories, both perform fairly well in terms of coverage and truthfulness.
